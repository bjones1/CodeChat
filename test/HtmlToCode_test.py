# HtmlToCode_test.py - Unit testing
# *********************************
# This test bench exercises the CodeToRest module. First, set up for
# development (see :ref:`To-package`). To run, execute ``py.test`` from the
# command line. Note the period in this command -- ``pytest`` does **NOT** work
# (it is a completely different program).
