# This file configures Sphinx, which transforms restructured text (reST) into

# This file was originally created by sphinx-quickstart, then modified by hand.

#
# * This file is ``execfile()``\d by Sphinx with the current directory set to
#   its containing dir.
# * Not all possible configuration values are present in this autogenerated
#   file.
# * All configuration values have a default; values that are commented out
#   serve to show the default.
