# |docname| - Info on comment delimiters for many languages
# *********************************************************
# `CodeChat <__init__.py>` relies on knowledge of the comment
# delimiters for each supported language. This file consists of a large table
# which provides this information.
#
# Imports
# =======
# These are listed in the order prescribed by `PEP 8
# <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports>`_.
#
# Standard library
# ----------------
# None
#
# Third-party imports
# -------------------
from pygments.lexers import get_all_lexers

# Local application imports
# -------------------------
# None.


# Supported languages
# ===================
# Based on the unique name for each lexer, provide some additional information
# on comment delimiters that Pygments doesn't explicitly define. This data was
# mostly taken from the `Wikipedia page
# <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(syntax)#Comments>`_.
#
# `Disable Black <https://github.com/psf/black#the-black-code-style>`_ for this block.
