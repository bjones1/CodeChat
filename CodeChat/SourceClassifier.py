#
# Implementation
# ==============
# This function transforms source code in any format supported by `CommentDelimiterInfo.py` into an iterable of ``(type, string)`` tuples, where:
#
# - ``type`` is an integer giving the number of spaces in this comment's indent, or -1 if the comment is code. Note that non-CodeChat comments are classified as code.
# - ``string`` is one line of code or comment, ending with a newline. Comments are supplied with the indent and delimiters removed.
#
# **This routine is the heart of the algorithm.**
def source_lexer(
    # _`code_str`: the code to classify.

    # The lexer used to analyze the code.

    # * If there's no multi-line start info, then classify generic comments as
    #   inline.
    comment_is_inline = not cdi[1]
    # * Likewise, no inline info indicates that generic comments are block
    #   comments.
    comment_is_block = not cdi[0]

    # 1.    Invoke a Pygments lexer on the provided source code, obtaining an
    #       iterable of tokens. Also analyze Python code for docstrings.
    #
    token_iter, ast_docstring, ast_syntax_error = _pygments_lexer(code_str, lexer)

    #       or other.

    # 3.    Make a per-line list of [group, ws_len, string], so that the last
    #       string in each list ends with a newline. Change the group of block
    #       comments that actually span multiple lines.
    gathered_group = _gather_groups_on_newlines(token_group, cdi)

#
#   <div class="CodeChat-indent">    An indent from CodeChat -- not present with no indent.
#       <p>Text.</p>                 DO NOT change this element's bottom margin.
#       <p>Some text here</p>        This could be any element.
#   </div>
#   <div class="highlight-xxx">      Where xxx is the language name, such as c, python, etc.

):

    # Pygments does some cleanup on the code given to it before lexing it. If
    # this is Python code, we want to run AST on that cleaned-up version, so
    # that AST results can be correlated with Pygments results. However,
    # Pygments doesn't offer a way to do this; so, add that ability in to the
    # detected lexer.
    preprocessed_code_str = _pygments_get_tokens_preprocess(lexer, code_str)
    # Note: though Pygments does support a `String.Doc token type <http://pygments.org/docs/tokens/#literals>`_,
    # it doesn't truly identify docstring; from Pygments 2.1.3,
    # ``pygments.lexers.python.PythonLexer``:
    #
    # .. code-block:: Python3
    #    :linenos:
    #    :lineno-start: 55
    #
    #    (r'^(\s*)([rRuU]{,2}"""(?:.|\n)*?""")', bygroups(Text, String.Doc)),
    #    (r"^(\s*)([rRuU]{,2}'''(?:.|\n)*?''')", bygroups(Text, String.Doc)),
    #
    # which means that ``String.Doc`` is simply *ANY* triple-quoted string.
    # Looking at other lexers, ``String.Doc`` often refers to a
    # specially-formatted comment, not a docstring. From
    # ``pygments.lexers.javascript``:
    #
    # .. code-block:: Javascript
    #    :linenos:
    #    :lineno-start: 591
    #
    #    (r'//.*?\n', Comment.Single),
    #    (r'/\*\*!.*?\*/', String.Doc),
    #    (r'/\*.*?\*/', Comment.Multiline),
    #
    # So, the ``String.Doc`` token can't be used in any meaningful way by
    # CodeToRest to identify docstrings. Per Wikipedia's `docstrings article
    # <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring>`_, only three languages support
    # this feature. So, we'll need a language-specific approach. For Python,
    # `PEP 0257 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257>`_ provides the
    # syntax and even some code to correctly remove docstring indentation. The
    # `ast <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/ast.html>`_ module provides
    # routines which parse a given Python string without executing it, which
    # is better than evaluating arbitrary Python then looking at its
    # ``__doc__`` attributes.
    #
    # Perhaps the approach would be to scan with ast, then see if the line
    # number matches the ending line number of a string, and if so convert the
    # string into a comment. Trickiness: Python will merge strings; consider
    # the following:
    #
    # .. code-block:: pycon
    #    :linenos:
    #
    #    >>> def foo():
    #    ...     ("""A comment.""" \
    #    ...      ' More.'
    #    ...      " And more.")
    #    ...     pass
    #    ...
    #    >>> print(foo.__doc__)
    #    A comment. More. And more.
    #
    # It's probably best not to support this case. Unfortunately, AST reports
    # this as a single string, rather than as a list of several elements.
    # The approach: make sure the docstring found by ast is in the text of a
    # Pygments string token. If so, replace the string token by a block
    # comment, whose contents come from ``inspect.cleandoc`` of the docstring.
    #
    # So, process this with AST if this is Python or Python3 code to find docstrings.
    # If found, store line number and docstring into ``ast_docstring``.
    ast_docstring = {}
    # Provide a place to store syntax errors resutling from parsing the Python code.
    ast_syntax_error = ""

# Block comment indentation processing
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# #. A single line: ``/* comment */``. No special handling needed.
# #. Multiple lines, indented with spaces. For example:
#
#    .. code-block:: c
#       :linenos:
#
#       Column:  1
#       1234567890234567
#
#         /* A multi-
#
#            line
#         WRONG INDENTATION
#              string
#          */
#
#    In the code above, the text of the comment begins at column 6 of line 4,
#    with the letter A. Therefore, line 7 lacks the necessary 6-space indent,
#    so that no indentation will be removed from this comment.
#
#    If line 6 was indented properly, the resulting reST would be:
#
#    .. code-block:: rest
#
#       ...rest to indent the left margin of the following text 2 spaces...
#
#       A multi-
#
#       line
#       RIGHT INDENTATION
#         string
#
#       ...rest to end the left margin indent...
#
#    Note that the first 5 characters were stripped off each line, leaving only
#    line 8 indented (preserving its indentation relative to the comment's
#    indentation). Some special cases in doing this processing:
#
#    * Line 5 may contain less than the expected 5 space indent: it could be
#      only a newline. This must be supported with a special case.
#    * The comment closing (line 9) contains just 3 spaces; this is allowed.
#      If there are non-space characters before the closing comment delimiter,
#      they must not occur before column 6. For example,
#
#      .. code-block:: c
#
#         /* A multi-
#            line comment */
#
#      and
#
#      .. code-block:: c
#
#         /* A multi-
#            line comment
#         */
#
#      have consistent indentation. In particular, the last line of a multi-line
#      comment may contain zero or more whitespace characters followed by the
#      closing block comment delimiter. However,
#
#      .. code-block:: c
#
#         /* A multi-
#           line comment */
#
#      is not sufficiently indented to qualify for indentation removal.
#

#
#    .. code-block:: c
#       :linenos:
#
#       Column:  1
#       1234567890123456789
#         /* Multi-

#          *
#          *WRONG INDENTATION
#         *  WRONG INDENTATION
#          */
#
#    The rules are similar to the previous case (indents with space alone).
#    However, there is one special case: line 5 doesn't require a space after
#    the asterisk; a newline is acceptable. If the indentation is corrected, the
#    result is:
#

#
#       ...rest to indent the left margin of the following text 2 spaces...
