# Although there is a `max-doc-length <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/options.html#cmdoption-flake8-max-doc-length>`_, setting this still produces lots of error about long lines, even if those lines are just a comment. The docs on `max-line-length <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/options.html#cmdoption-flake8-max-line-length>`_ states that it applies to ALL lines -- including comments -- unless they contain a URL or a string. So, set this to allow long comments.
