# Packaging notes
# ===============
# Reading to get up to speed:
#
# * `Python Packaging User Guide <http://packaging.python.org/en/latest/>`_ -
#   the most up-to-date reference I've found so far. Tells which tools to
#   actually use.
#
# * `setuptools <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools>`_ - A distutils
#   replacement which can install dependencies, so I use it.
#
#
# .. _to-package:
#
# To package
# ==========
# Create a source distribution, a built distribution, then upload both to
# `CodeChat at PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/CodeChat>`_:
#
# .. code-block:: console
#   :linenos:
#
#   python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel twine build
#   python -m build
#   python -m twine upload dist/*
#
# To create an RPM, first manually edit the ``name=`` setting to add a ``python3-`` prefix and lowercase the name (e.g. ``name=python3-codechat``, not ``name=python3-CodeChat``). Then, use (on an RPM-based Linux distribution):
#
# .. code-block:: console
#   :linenos:
#
#   python3 setup.py bdist_rpm
#
# For `development
# <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#development-mode>`_:
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#   :linenos:
#
#   pip install -e .[test]
#
#
# Packaging script
# ================
# Otherwise known as the evils of ``setup.py``.

# PyPA copied code

# From `PyPA's sample setup.py
# <https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.py>`__,
# read ``long_description`` from a file. This code was last updated on
# 26-May-2015 based on `this commit
# <https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/commit/4687e26c8a61e72ae401ec94fc1e5c0e17465b73>`_.

    long_description = re.sub(

# to ``setup`` below.

# My code
# -------
# We support Python 3.4 and higher. I could instead use `python_requires <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#python-requires>`_, but it seems like this is a new feature, so avoid it for now so that installs on older Python versions still work.
